# Angular UI Helpers
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-badge-url]
  
A collection of components, directives and pipes for solving Html forms/UI problems. This is a rewrite of my old [jQuery plugins project](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/web-dev-suite).  
  
Currently developed:
- Pipe and component options to solve problem with Html select input elements that have long option elements: 
  - Shortens long text using a custom pipe
  - Shortens select element options using a custom select-shorten component
  - See select-shorted-demo.component.spec.ts for tests
  
Tests written in Jasmine using Karma.
- `npm test' - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
  
This project was build using [Angular QuickStart Source](https://github.com/angular/quickstart).
